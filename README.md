# MINIMORPHIC

Design-led modular computing.

This repository contains the core development assets for the Minimorphic platform — a minimalist, future-forward laptop architecture built around precision industrial design and flush expansion modules.

It brings together mechanical design, electronics, firmware, and system documentation in a unified workspace for developing the Minimorphic ecosystem.

**Project site:** https://minimorphic.github.io   

## Scope

- Industrial design (CAD, enclosure systems)
- Electronics (PCB designs, schematics)
- Firmware and low-level software
- Expansion module architecture
- Prototyping files and research
- System documentation

## Philosophy

Minimorphic explores computing as a physical design system — where hardware components behave as modular forms that integrate seamlessly into a cohesive object.

Minimal form. Maximum function. Continuous evolution.
