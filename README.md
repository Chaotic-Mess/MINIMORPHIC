This is MINIMORPHIC, A place where I share my personal projects: where they are, the things I bought, the things I didn’t, the things I designed. CAD files, links, notes, and inspirations — all here in one repo.

Not a company. Not a startup. Just me. And that’s okay.

## What’s in (and will be) this repo 

- Projects: project folders with notes, phases, and updates
- CAD: design files and exports
- Firmware & code: drivers, sketches, and tools
- References: links, research, and inspiration

## How I use this

- I log progress in project update posts.
- Use the project folders to find CAD, build notes, and links.
- Nothing here is polished — it’s a record of what I built and why.
