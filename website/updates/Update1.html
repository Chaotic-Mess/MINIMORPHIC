            On January 30th, 2026, at 11:50pm, MINIMORPHIC was born. A simple idea took root: to build SLATE, a custom
            laptop
            from the ground up. This is the beginning of a journey defined by innovation, experimentation,
        </p>
        <p class="fade d4">
            and relentless pursuit of a vision. No corporate gloss, just raw progress and the occasional breakthrough.

        <div class="quote fade d5">
            MINIMORPHIC is not just a project; it’s a commitment to creating something different, something better.
            Welcome to the journey.
